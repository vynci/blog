title: About Me
---

I am a passionate geek whose into experimental technologies whether it is on the software, hardware or firmware development scene.

I currently work as a Full Stack Javascript Developer here in Cebu City Philippines, wherein we use frontend frameworks
such as AngularJS and BackboneJS. I also design backend Service Oriented Architectures mostly using node.js, while utilizing amqp(rabbitmq as  broker) and mqtt(mosquitto as broker) protocols.

In the light of me being a licensed Electronics Engineer. I also build side projects on Home Automation, Robotics, and other Control Systems using Microcontrollers and Algorithms using PID Controllers.

I usually combine my work experience as a software developer and my Electroncics Engineering degree to build hardware, software and cloud computing integration projects. When I first heard about Internet of Things(IoT), I fell in love with it instantly because I've been doing it already before without realizing that it is already a "thing" these days.

I also do self studies on Machine Learning Algorithms specifically in Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network classification and regression algorithms as well as in Fuzzy Logic formulation.
