PRIME is a network of sensor modules that is based on PIC16F877A microntrollers. It uses Sound Pressure Level(SPL) sensors to detect loud sounds of chainsaw in the forest. It is also equipped with an onboard GSM Modem, wherein it sends an SMS warning to the officials when it reaches the treshold value. The system also has a mechanism that can call the official when the chainsaw saw sound that is transpiring on the ground exceeded 10 seconds, so that he/she can verify that it really is a chainsaw.
