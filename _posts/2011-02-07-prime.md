The Preventive Illegal Logging Monitoring Endeavor (Prime) used sensors to detect chainsaw sounds and SMS and GSM technology to send out alerts. Whenever an alert is triggered, the system initiates a phone call to a designated recipient so that the person can listen and confirm whether the sound is really that of a chainsaw.

The project was inspired by the thought of the system after learning of the illegal logging in the Binahaan Watershed in Albuera, Leyte. He said the Community Environment and Natural Resources Officer (Cenro) of the watershed has expressed interest in deploying the system. Each Prime node can cover 1.5 hectares.
